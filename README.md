Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. Organizing and analyze a database of 4,000 past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.

Here are 3 conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns.
1. The most Kickstarter projects are in the Theater category, Play sub-category, with 37% more projects over the second most sub-category type (Rock).
2. Thereâ€™s a seasonal decline in the number of projects over the course of the year
3. The most backed successful projects were in Technology.

Limitations of this dataset:
The data collected is an international collection, however most projects are conducted in the US. Markets for different countries will vary depending on interest and availability.
Each project has varying time periods to reach their goal. 


Other tables and/or graphs that could be created:
Time range between creation and deadline vs. state
The number of backers vs. category
Spotlight vs. State
